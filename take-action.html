                    WayForward's mission is to end the student debt crisis. We always place
                    the voices and needs of borrowers at the center of our advocacy to
                    achieve policy goals and we believe that believes that borrowers are the
                    best organizers. In addition to the work with individual borrowers, WayForward will continue
                    collaborative campaign efforts with partners.

                <p>
                    WayForward is in the business of WINNING legislation that will end this
                    crisis. Make no mistake about it, the goal is to alleviate the millions
                    of Americans suffering under the $1.7 trillion debt burden. WayForward
                    must win not only for our members but for the country as a whole, as

                    whole.
