                    I was the first in my family to go to college and graduate school. I had
                    a full scholarship for undergraduate. But had to take out massive public
                    and private student loans to attend grad school to get my doctorate (I
                    come from a family who always lived below the poverty line). So I should
                    have been able to pay back those loans easily right? Wrong. Many things
                    happened along the way…. Divorce, relocation, both parents suffered
                    strokes so I became their caregiver/sole provider along with caring for
                    my own two children as a single mom. Here I am, 20 years later and I
                    still owe $104,000 and I my oldest child is now filling out her FAFSA. I
                    will NEVER get my loans paid off with 4 dependents (disabled parents and
                    my children). Not to mention never being able to retire because of them.
                    It is hopeless.

                    I am a 58 yr old public service worker, I went back to school because I
                    needed to know Excel for my job. I was told that I couldn't take just
                    that one class, I had to enroll part-time in the City Colleges. I didn't
                    receive Financial Aid, because I lived alone, I did have a dependent
                    living with me ( even though I took out loans for my daughter, she has
                    student loans too) and I worked. I was only offered federal loans. I did
                    well, which helped me to get scholarships along with my student loans.
                    That eased the burden a little. I graduated with an AA Degree. I would
                    have like to go further and gotten my Bachelors Degree, but because of
                    the cost of the loans I took out for community college, I had to stop my
                    pursuit of a further education. I really couldn't afford it, now. I'm in
                    a position to retire from my job, but I won't be able to now, because of
                    Covid-19, loan debt and my health. I have a heart condition which limits
                    me. I need the health insurance, so I don't have a lot of options, I
                    will just have to work longer. I really need help with these student
                    loans.
