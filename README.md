# WayForward

A spec website I designed for a fictional nonprofit organization that is trying to bring awareness to the student debt crisis. I concepted and designed the overall visual direction for the site.

All copy pulled from the very real Student Debt Crisis Center, a nonprofit fighting to end the student debt crisis: https://studentdebtcrisis.org/

A working demo can be found here: https://wayforward.glitch.me/index.html
